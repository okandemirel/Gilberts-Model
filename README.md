# Gilberts-Model

This is a example for Gilberts Magnet Model, made with Unity 3D.



Added two scenes.
One of these scene is working with raycastin for controls, and the other one is for screen touch & drag controls.

You will find a blue and few more red boxes in these scenes. Blue one is magnet itself and red ones are metals that are needed to be pulled by magnet.

There is a Button for activating all the magnets, by clicking it you will see more blue boxes. (This will show you the pushing part of the Gilberts Model.)

Also there is a scroll for electromagnets force value. (You can check out for possible variations.)
